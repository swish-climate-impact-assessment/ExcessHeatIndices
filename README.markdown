Excess Heat Indices	
-------------------

I’ve been working for Geoff Morgan (Geoff.Morgan@ncahs.health.nsw.gov.au) who is finalising a consultancy with NSW health to look at heatwaves, mortality and admissions. We use the percentiles of daily max temperature and apparent temperature in a similar way to the paper by Behnoosh Khalaj and Keith Dear. In additional sensitivity analyses we also developed material related to a newly proposed heatwave metric.

The reports/EHIs_transformations_doc.Rnw file contains R code that you can execute and produce the calculations and the graphs that get compiled into that pdf file. 
These R codes are also held separately in the run directory if you prefer.

Some Background
---------------

We were asked by our NSW health collaborators to investigate some heatwave indices developed by the BoM. NSW BoM like the look of three indices invented at the SA BoM office  (by John Nairn) - they want to construct a national definition. Apparently BoM central HQ like John's definition the most (not published in a journal yet, the best ref is http://www.cawcr.gov.au/events/modelling_workshops/workshop_2009/papers/NAIRN.pdf). 

John has worked with PriceWaterhouseCoopers to apply the heatwave in a recent report http://www.pwc.com.au/industry/government/assets/extreme-heat-events-nov11.pdf
